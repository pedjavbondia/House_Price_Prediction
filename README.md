Goal: Find a Machine Learning Model that best performs in predicting House Price.

Models that were tried: XGBoost Regressor and Random Forest combined with Lasso.  

The two models were evaluated using Mean Squared Error and Mean Absolute Error, also Scatter Plots were used to compare the relationship between Actual to Predicted values.
